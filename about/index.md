=====================

_"Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen."_  
--- Ludwig Wittgenstein, _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_.

Me
--
I'm a research software engineer broadly interested in writing programs that use probabilistic modelling and machine learning to look for structure in large troves of data. I strongly believe in developing well-motivated theory to explain patterns, and deploying automated machine learning solutions only when theory fails to explain observations.

Have something private to tell me? Reach me at `ptsw -at- protonmail -dot- com`.

Interests
---------
My current _professional_ interests are in cancer bioinformatics, where I try to solve problems in transcriptomics and genomics using large troves of sequencing data.

My current _amateur_ interests are in social theory, where I aspire to analyze opinion polls and financial datasets and interpret the results within social-theoretic and political-economic frameworks.

My _hobbies_ include computer-generated music, running, and problem-solving.

This Site
---------
I've been trying to blog more, I swear. Aside from that, it also serves as a catalog of all the stuff I do --- see the descriptively titled link to "stuff" in the header.

The title of this blog --- _plateaux_ --- is a reference to Deleuze and Guattari's [_Mille plateaux_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus).
This site is based on the <a href="https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper">white-paper</a> theme, which I find refreshingly minimal.
The background color has been modified to `#fff1e0`, the same tint as my favorite newspaper.
