Me
--
I'm a research engineer working in cancer bioinformatics, where I try to solve problems in sequence analysis, transcriptomics, and genomics with tools from probabilistic modelling and machine learning.

Have something private to tell me? Reach me at `ptsw -at- protonmail -dot- com`.

This Site
---------
I've been trying to blog more, I swear. Aside from that, it also serves as a catalog of all the stuff I do --- see the descriptively titled link to "stuff" in the header.

The title of this blog --- _plateaux_ --- is a reference to Deleuze and Guattari's [_Mille plateaux_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus).

This blog is based on Vinit Kumar's <a href="https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper">white-paper</a> theme. I find it refreshingly minimal. I added a couple of minor modifications to make it more anti-social.
