Me
--
I'm a machine learning engineer broadly interested in writing programs that use probabilistic modelling and machine learning to look for structure in large troves of data. I strongly believe in developing well-motivated theory to explain patterns, and deploying automated machine learning solutions when theory fails to explain observations and as a supplement to theory.

Interests
---------
My current interests are in social theory, where I aspire to analyze opinion polls and financial datasets and interpret the results within social-theoretic and political-economic frameworks. I am also interested in quantitative bioinformatics, especially in the application of techniques from bayesian statistics and machine learning towards genetic sequencing analysis, transcriptomics, and coalescent theory. I try (and fail) to stay up to date on current research in quantum machine learning.

My _hobbies_ include computer-generated music, running, and problem-solving.

This Site
---------
I've been trying to blog more, I swear. Aside from that, it also serves as a catalog of all the stuff I do --- see the descriptively titled link to "stuff" in the header.

The title of this blog --- _plateaux_ --- is a reference to Deleuze and Guattari's [_Mille plateaux_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus).
This site is based on the <a href="https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper">white-paper</a> theme, which I find refreshingly minimal.
The background color has been modified to `#fff1e0`.
