Hello,

Apologies for lack of response/activity; the usage of Facebook (as well as other social networks) is almost exactly contrary to my (admittedly unpopular) view of how society should interact with technology, so I try to limit my usage as much as I can and restrict myself to the occasional message (if that, and only if necessary). In short, I am a complete ``technophobe'' (at least with regards to social networks) as a result of seeing how the sausage is made, so to speak --- even just a cursory understanding of the Document-Object Model API provided by most browsers would shock the privacy-minded person once they see what is possible to track. To put it bluntly, centralized data scares and nauseates me, and I have absolutely no desire to contribute to it.

At the same time, I cannot deny that it functions as a useful rolodex for (e.g., long-lost) friends --- and for that reason it is not in my interest to delete it entirely. It makes sense to keep an active profile, while at the same time avoiding any contribution towards it and slowly chipping away at my online persona.

As a friend, I hope that you will honour my decision to avoid the usual trappings of social networks and contact me through email, at ``paulswtang@gmail.com''. (Please use it if you have a need to contact me, as I will most likely not send a response through this messaging platform --- at least not in a timely manner.) Thanks in advance for understanding.

A personal write-up that elaborates on the issue is in an editing phase.

Cheers,

PT

P.S. --- RMS's thoughts on the matter almost completely correlate with mine, and are (in my opinion) a good starting point to understanding the downsides of social networking:

P.P.S. --- Yes, I am fully aware that the above may sound quite pretentious.
