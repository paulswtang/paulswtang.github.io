Some Personal Opinions on Social Networks
=========================================

(Written Apr. 9 2015)

It is no secret to those that know me on a personal level that I am not a fan of "conventional" social networks. As someone that entered legal adulthood in the late 2000s, I did of course get caught up in the emergent hype of Facebook, Twitter, et. al.; as time proceeded, my opinion on the matter evolved from an apathetic one to a strongly-held (but pragmatic) conviction, and I am currently in the process of decommissioning my profiles on these networks (slowly, but surely).

The rest of this document will explain my views on social networks (though [RMS explains it better than I could](https://stallman.org/facebook.html)).

### "What's your issue with social networking?"

* There is an old adage of economics --- "*there ain't no such thing as a free lunch*". As a "pseudo-free" service, users (henceforth referred to as "visitors") of general-purpose social networks offer their own secrets and personal details to improve the structure of Facebook's advertisement exchange. This, in-and-of-itself, is not immoral; and indeed Facebook, Twitter, et. al. have done great good through their existence in various pro-democratic settings. This does not invalidate the claim that the centralization of analytic insights into consumer patterns --- indeed, analytics that are *not* aggregated but tied to each visitor --- is clearly dangerous. %%%%%%%

* Aside from the danger of centralized visitor data, there is the relationship between social networking and culture/society. From a purely personal perspective, I have absolutely no desire to take part in the culture emerging from social networks --- though, as previously stated, I can see the value in their existence, justified by %%%%%%% With that said, the constructed semiotics of the major social networks are non-trivial.

* Social networks contribute to the construction of a panopticon culture. %%%%%%

* We, as imperfect social actors, should have the ability to forget our past and shape our own outward-facing images. At the crux of this point is the "schizophrenia" (as an acquaintance would call it) between the social roles of emotive-self and the rational-self; modern society has little tolerance for the former and insists on the latter, although the existence of both are fundamental to one's mental well-being. Facebook, for instance, is an excellent platform for businesses, whether brick-and-mortar or multinational; it is less than ideal for the individual that alternates between jocular, pensive, and depressive moods.

* It is possible that I am already too late, and that a full model/profile of my activity can be constructed. Even if this were the case, however, there remains a handful of reasonable arguments to cutting social networks out of my life: 

1. As people, our personalities naturally evolve over time, and hence the discontinuation of web presence will mean that any inferences on my character will diverge from the truth with high probability as time passes.

### "But Paul, you still have a Github account. What's up with that?"

As hinted above, I do believe in the value of pragmatism. Github is an advertisement-free service that utilises a paid profit model (indeed, one that I do in fact pay for), and I have seen no indication that they might use my data in the same way that Facebook does. Github is unable to compile an accurate %%%%%%

### "...And what about your existing Facebook account?"

Facebook is the hardest one to get rid of due to its early adoption and the fact that it acts as a combination of rolodex, messaging platform, and life-scrapbook. With that said, current plans are to remove all traces of my existence from the publicly visible portions of the network, leaving a single photograph for reference --- so that my profile becomes a combination of advanced e-mail and a personal rolodex of long-lost friends.
