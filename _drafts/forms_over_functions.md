Forms over functions
====================
In this note, I'm going to try to convince you to look at several machine learning algorithms from the perspective of _differential forms_ instead of basic functions of a real variable. The idea is that differential forms are essentially functions that carry nice properties with them, which causes them to play well with vector spaces; and that replacing real-valued functions with a differential form whenever they appear in a machine learning algorithm is a painless extension that brings theoretical (if not practical) benefits with them.

What are differential forms?
