		<p id="blocktext">
			It's quite reductive to try to pin a person down into a few key sentences. With that said, I'm quite interested in the following things:
		</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: none" id="blocktext">
			<li>Mathematics, especially branches with a geometric flavour.</li>
			<li>Computer Science theory, especially computability, PL theory, type theory, and machine learning.</li>
			<li>Semiotics, primarily applied towards industrial design. (One might infer my interest in colors from this page.)</li>
			<li>Jazz, especially on piano (e.g., Thelonious Monk, Art Tatum) and synthesizer (e.g., Sun Ra).</li>
			</ul>
		<p id="blocktext">
			I have formal training in the first two and the rest are hobbies (though I am not entirely incompetent at the piano).
		</p>
		<p id="blocktext">
			I often do a bit of consulting, especially in regards to topics that are both mathematical and informatic in nature. To date, I have built: recommendation engines, front-end data analytics dashboards, RESTful APIs, analytics pipelines (in Hadoop, Storm, Spark, and more), and on-demand predictive frameworks. I am currently open to consulting contracts.

			I don't like giving away my personal information so easily due to <a href="http://paulswtang.com/notes/social.md">my views</a> on privacy in this current era; I tend to stay off of all mainstream social networks (<a href="https://github.com/paulswtang">github</a> is an exception).

			With that said, one may email me via ``me-(at)-(this-domain dot com)'' or via ``paulswtang-(at)-(popular email service beginning with a 'g', dot com)'', and if I've given you a simple keyphrase you can also obtain my full contact information by decrypting <a href="http://paulswtang.com/notes/contact.txt.gpg">this</a> file, via ``gpg contact.txt.gpg'' on the command line and typing the keyphrase when prompted. It is encrypted via GPG's default CAST5 symmetric cipher and is unsigned (so don't worry if it complains upon decryption).

		<h3 id="colheading">Notes + Writings.</h3>
		<p id="blocktext">
			I tend to learn a topic best through the process of interpretation and elaboration. This usually means I compile a lot of notes. I tend to excise some of my thoughts on <a href="http://pswtang.wordpress.com">my blog</a>, but the following are long-form notes that don't fit the style of a blog post. <br>
			<br>
			<a href="http://paulswtang.com/notes/quantization/index.html">Notes</a> on the geometry of quantization. <br>
			<br>
			<a href="http://paulswtang.com/notes/types/index.html">Notes</a> on the lambda-calculus, type theory, and relevant category theory, with code in Haskell and/or OCaml.
