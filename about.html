		I tend to learn a topic best through the process of interpretation and elaboration. This usually means I compile a lot of notes. I tend to excise <a href="http://pswtang.wordpress.com">my blog</a>, but the following are long-form notes that don't fit the style of a blog post. <br>
		<br>
		Notes on the geometry of quantization. <br>
		<br>
		Notes on the lambda-calculus, type theory, and relevant category theory, with code in Haskell and/or OCaml.

		It's quite reductive to try to pin the totality of a person down into a few key sentences. With that said, I'm quite interested in the following things:
		<ul style="list-style-type: none" id="blocktext">
		<li>Mathematics, especially branches with a geometric flavour</li>
		<li>Theoretical Computer Science, especially computability and programming language theory</li>
		<li>Semiotics (the study of signs and symbolism), primarily in conjunction with industrial design</li>
		<li>Jazz, esp. on piano -- Thelonious Monk is an inspiration</li>
		</ul>

		I don't like giving away my personal information so easily due to <a href="notes/social.md">my views</a> on privacy in this new era of the internet; I tend to stay off of all mainstream social networks (<a href="https://github.com/paulswtang">github</a> is an exception).

		With that said, one may email me via ``me-(at)-(this-domain dot com)'', and if I've given you a simple keyphrase -- it appears on my business cards -- you can also obtain my full contact information by decrypting <a href="notes/contact.txt.gpg">this</a> file.
